## Project 2

### Background

The game was created for completion of the second Milestone Project for the Software Development and E-commerce Applications diploma. It was built using the knowledge gained from HTML, CSS and JavaScrip modules of the course.
The objective of the game is to entertain users in a quick and simple way.

## User Experience 

The game was designed to be simple, in terms of the layout and the functionality to play. Visual elements such as pictures were added to attract users while making their choice of rock, paper or scissors. 

## Game design 

The game is displayed in a one page layout to allow a quick and simple user experience.

-**Game instructions** - The rule of the game is displayed only one sentence, aiming for quick reading, and inviting users to make their selection by clicking on an image of their choice.

-**Colors and background**- Colours of the website are light grey and black. Colours and background of the site are taught to be of a relaxing shade and elegant, with a retro style.

-**Typography** – I have selected font “Raleway” font sourced from Google Fonts library.
