## Project 2

### Background

The game was created for completion of the second Milestone Project for the Software Development and E-commerce Applications diploma. It was built using the knowledge gained from HTML, CSS and JavaScrip modules of the course.
The objective of the game is to entertain users in a quick and simple way.

## User Experience 

The game was designed to be simple in terms the layout and the functionality to play. Visual elements such as pictures were added to attract users, specifically when making a choice at the game play, and also seeing the choice selected by the computer.

## Game design 

The game is displayed in a one page layout to allow for quick and simple user experience.

-**Game instructions** - The rules of the game are simple and displayed in the page layout inviting users to make their selection by clicking on an image of their choice.

-**Colors and background**- Colours of the website are mainly grey and black. Colours and background of the site are taught to be of a relaxing shade and elegant, and are to create a retro feel.

-**Typography** – I have selected font “Raleway” font sourced from Google Fonts library.
